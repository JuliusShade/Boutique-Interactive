## Overview

The Dynamic Report Builder is an intuitive and user-friendly application designed to create customized reports from a database. Users can select fields, apply filters, and sort data to generate real-time reports. This tool offers flexibility in reporting and saves queries for future reference.

## Features

- **Field Selection**: Choose the data columns you want to include in your report from a list of database fields.
- **Filter Application**: Use the pop-up entry fields to set specific filters for each column to refine your data.
- **Sorting**: Sort the data in your report by ascending (Asc) or descending (Desc) order based on the selected column.
- **Report Generation**: View the generated reports instantly on the screen below the 'Generate Report' button.
- **Report Saving**: Save your customized reports for later use. The SQL query that reflects your report configuration is stored in the table at the bottom of the interface.

## How to Use

1. **Select Fields**: Click on the desired fields in the list to include them in your report.
2. **Apply Filters**: Click 'Apply Filters' to open entry fields where you can input conditions for each selected column.
3. **Choose Sorting**: Select a column from the 'Sort By' dropdown and choose 'Asc' or 'Desc' to set the sorting order.
4. **Generate Report**: Click the 'Generate Report' button to display the report on screen.
5. **Save Report**: To save the report, enter a name for it in the 'Enter report name' field and click 'Save Report'. The corresponding SQL query will appear in the 'Reports List' table.
6. **Manage Reports**: Use the 'Refresh' button to update the list of saved reports or select reports and click 'Delete Selected Reports' to remove them from the list.
